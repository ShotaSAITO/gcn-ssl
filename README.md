# gcn-ssl
Implementation of GCN and regularization graph Semi-supervised learning.

## Implemetations

### Graph CNN based SSL
This is an implemntaion of semi-supervised learning via neural network with multiple layers of graph CNNs. The implementation of [1].

### Graph Regularization based SSL
To compare with Graph CNN based SSL, the regularization method [2] is a suitablly clasical one. The implementation of [2].
